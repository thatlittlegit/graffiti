# Graffiti
Graffiti is a [MediaWiki](https://mediawiki.org) mirror for the
[Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space) protocol. It currently just takes in
the Wikitext via the API and gives it to the user as preformatted text. By
default, it works with Wikipedia, NetHack Wiki and ExplainXKCD.

Eventually, I hope to turn this into a server: however, that won't happen in
this repository.

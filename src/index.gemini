# Graffiti
Graffiti is a MediaWiki portal for Gemini. A limited selection of wikis are
available, but they include the English Wikipedia, the NetHack Wiki, and Explain
XKCD.

The software is written in Rust, and is available on GitHub via HTTPS (eww).

Currently, these wikis are available:
=> /wikipedia English Wikipedia
=> /nethack NetHack Wiki
=> /xkcd Explain XKCD

## How it Works
It uses Reqwest to send an API call using the MediaWiki API. This response is
currently shovelled back to you in an preformatted area.

I plan to shift this server over to a more complete, generic server. At that
point, I'll move Graffiti from a full Gemini server into a CGI-like Perl script
that uses HTTP::Tiny, and actually parses some Wikitext into Gemini format.

(Do note that sidebars wouldn't be transformed: it requires too much knowledge
about the wiki.)

## Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
Don't spam requests, don't do anything illegal. I don't log anything you put in.
However, wikis might, and I plan to pass an X-Forwarded-For header with your IP.
Just don't do anything if you won't do it directly to the wiki, please.
